Jordan Brindza

- I was unable to find any good spring constants that worked for Euler integration.
  Midpoint is stable in some circumstances but not nearly as much as RK4.

- I implemented cylinder, circle and cube/box collision detection.

- I attempted to implement Verlet and Velocity Verlet integration but I didn't 
  have time to fully test them or find gains that work.

- I also implemented diagonal shear springs which you can enable by setting
  USE_DIAG_SHEAR to true in jelloMesh.cpp. I don't think I had enough time to
  test them for good spring constants as they didn't improve the euler performance much.

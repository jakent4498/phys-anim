Jordan Brindza CIS 563 - Smoke Simulation

1)  Describe the difference between Lagrangian and Eulerian viewpoints for
    simulation.  Why is the approach used in this assignment called Semi-Lagragian?

  The Eulerian approach discritizes the world into a grid and then measures fluid
  statistics for each grid cell by observing the fluid traveling through it. The 
  Lagrangian approach treats the fluid like a particle system.

  Our approach is called a semi-Lagrangian because we use a discretized world
  for storing the fluid properties but treat the cells as particles for
  computing the velocity updates.


2)  Smoke and water can both be simulated with fluids.  Briefly explain how they
    are similar and how they are different.  

  Smoke and water simulation are similar in that they both satisfy the
  Navier-Stokes equations for fluids. 

  They are different because water has a well defined surface that does not
  exist in smoke. 

3)  List one advantage and one disadvantage to simulating our fluid on a grid.
    Describe two other techniques for simulating fluids and the advantages and
    disadvantages of each.

  One advantage to using a grid is that it makes computing the 

  One advantage to simulating the fluid on a grid is that it is computationally
  efficient (cpu time and memory). One Disadvantage is the grid creates

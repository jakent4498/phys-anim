1. In class, we talked about problems with contact processing stacks of objects.
Naively, you would have to do many iteractions to resolve contact problems with
stacks. How does shock propagation help solve this problem? 

2. Explain the trade-offs encountered between a bounding sphere and using the
convex hull? 

  The bounding sphere has the advantage of being quicker to compute possible
  collisions between objects then using the convex hull. However, the convex
  hull is a better approximation of the objects actual shape so it has less
  false positive, possible collisions when used. 

  Another downside to the convex hall is that it is difficult to compute for
  arbitrary objects, but it is only an initial time investment at the beginning
  of the simulation and the convex halls can be cached.

3. Can you theorize a better way to pick the best sweep directions in SaP(sweep
and prune), talked about in class? We have assumed in class we will just naively
use the three coordinate axes as the sweep direction. But in general this gives
a poor result.

4. How would you combine particles and rigid bodies to simulate granular
particles such as sand or dust? Granular particles exhibit both rigid body and
particle properties so a naive SPH implmenetation would not look realistic out
of the box.
